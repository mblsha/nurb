"""`nurb render` is how an agent sees its own work, so a blank PNG is a silent failure.

The trap this guards is specific. Every piece can look healthy while the image is
useless: the server serves, the page loads, the screenshot writes, and WebGL quietly did
not draw, or the camera never moved to the view that was asked for. Both come out as a
file with the right name and a plausible size.

So the assertion is that two views of one part are two different pictures. Nothing about
that passes if the canvas is blank or the view parameter is ignored.
