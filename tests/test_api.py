"""`nurb api` is derived, so it cannot drift from what a part file can call.

The point of the command is that an agent stops reading site-packages to find out what
`concave_edges` returns. That only holds if the output is generated from the functions
themselves; a hand-written list would be a second copy of the vocabulary and would go
stale exactly when someone adds to the first one.
