"""Headless PNG of a part, so an agent can see its own work.

It drives the same viewer a human uses, on a private port, rather than rendering
offscreen with a second graphics stack. Two reasons: the image is then the thing the
human would see, and nothing new has to know how to light a scene or where the camera
goes. It costs a browser, which is why Playwright is an optional dependency and this is
the only module that imports it.

No dev server has to be running. This starts one, serves the viewer for as long as the
screenshot takes, and stops it. The file watcher is deliberately not started: nothing is
going to change during a render.
