"""Assemblies: placed parts, a joint, and the sweep that catches a jam before a print.

Every rule in checks.py judges one solid being manufactured. Nothing judges two solids
being *used*: a door that cannot open past 45 degrees builds clean, checks clean,
exports watertight and prints beautifully, because no check anywhere holds the door and
its mount in the same hand. The failure is only visible in the motion, and the motion
was in nobody's model. This module puts it in the model.

An assembly is a part file whose function returns placed solids instead of one solid:

    from nurb import *

    @assembly
    def privacy_cover(open_deg=0.0):
        mount = use("prompter_mount")
        door = Pos(0, 30, 24) * Rot(0, 0, 180) * use("prompter_door")
        door = hinge(door, Axis((0, 38, 24), (1, 0, 0)), through=(0, 180), at=open_deg)
        machine = obstacle(Pos(0, -100, -110) * Box(224, 230, 219), "the prompter")
        return mount, door, machine

The joint parameter is an ordinary keyword default, so the viewer's existing slider
already animates it: drag `open_deg` and the door swings in the browser. Nothing in the
viewer knows assemblies exist.

`nurb check` on an assembly checks declared clearance() pairs at their current pose and sweeps declared hinges through their ranges. Component identities survive placement and rendering so a finding can identify both objects. Printability rules still run where they belong, on the individual parts.

Collision is measured as intersection volume, so two faces that merely kiss at zero
volume are reported clear; in plastic a zero-clearance pass is already a bind, and the
declared range should carry the same honesty about clearance that a tongue's `fit`
carries about width.
